# XDomain
Auto powerful subdomains scanner - Auto check live subdomains
The best thing in the life is autmoation. 
I enjoy coding stuff and I was searching for something to collect subdomains, I found a lot of tools, but I didn't find the automation part.
I made this tool based on different tools and my own code. XDomain will do the follwoing to get subdomains:

* Get subdomains from Amass.
* Get subdomains from Sublist3r.
* Get subdomains from Subbrute.
* Auto take the founded list of subdomains and find the live targets.
* Find hidden subdomains in JavaScript files from all the founded subdomains.
* Remove all duplicates.
* Take screenshot for every subdomain.
* Find the technology of every subdomain.
* Nmap scan against every subdomain.
* Generate a quick HTML report.

I was working on a bigger tool, but I didn't have time to continue it. I will try to add more stuff in the future. 
Please let me know your suggestions. Enjoy! :D
